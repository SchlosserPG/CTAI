#### Food for Thought

-   Despite widespread enthusiasm, recent evidence—including a new MIT Media Lab/Project NANDA report showing that 95% of generative AI investments yielded zero measurable returns—signals a growing wave of skepticism about AI delivering results at scale.

-   Further dampening expectations are the underwhelming debut of OpenAI’s GPT‑5 and Gartner’s assessment that generative AI is entering the “trough of disillusionment”—the third phase of its five‑stage hype‑cycle model.

## The Analytics Problem

#### Chapters 1 and 2 from Weber and Zwingmann (2024) outline the journey of building a data-driven organization—from understanding the foundations of data acquisition, APIs, and web scraping, to progressing through the data maturity stages (Reactive → Active → Progressive → Fluent) by aligning culture, strategy, people, and technology.

###### Chapter 1 and 2 at Weber, W., & Zwingmann, T. (2024). Augmented analytics. O’Reilly Media, Inc. Available at https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/augmented-analytics/9781098151713/

#### Historical Context: Industrial Transformations

-   Past revolutions:

    -   1760s: Steam power.

    -   Mid-1800s to 1910s: Electricity & mass production.

    -   Late 20th century–present: Computerization.

-   Current shift: Digital transformation driven by multiple converging technologies (AI, IoT, cloud, analytics) is faster and more complex than prior eras.

#### Why are Business Transforming?

-   Speed of Change

    -   Previous revolutions took decades; now transformation can occur in a few years.

    -   Example: Amazon vs. local bookstores; Uber vs. taxis; Industry 4.0 in manufacturing.

    -   Requires organizational agility and strong leadership.

![Figure 1-1. The growing amount of data worldwide. Adapted from Statista, as cited in Weber & Zwingmann (2024)](images/figure_1_1.png)

-   Convergence of Multiple Technologies

    -   Unlike single-tech revolutions, today’s changes combine AI, cloud, IoT, and advanced analytics.

    -   Leads to multidimensional complexity and unpredictable disruption timelines.

-   Importance of Data

    -   Data has shifted from being a byproduct to being a core strategic asset.

    -   Growth in unstructured data (text, images, video) creates new challenges.

    -   The “data as oil” analogy is flawed: data increases with use, is not scarce, but needs “refining” (cleaning, governance) to be valuable.

-   Changing Consumer Behavior & Customer Centricity

    -   "iPhone moments" reshape entire industries (examples: Shopify, Tesla, Amazon Prime, Netflix).

    -   Digital transformation now spans all sectors and is often triggered by heightened customer expectations.

#### Industries Most Impacted

-   McKinsey research highlights industries where big data & analytics are transformative:

    -   Agriculture – Precision farming, automation.

    -   Commercial insurance – Pricing, underwriting efficiency.

    -   Finance – Fraud detection, credit risk modeling.

    -   Healthcare – Personalized medicine, predictive diagnostics.

    -   IT – Automation, cybersecurity.

    -   Manufacturing – Predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization.

    -   Transportation – Route optimization, demand prediction.

    -   Utilities – Grid stability, renewable integration.

![Figure 1-2. Industries heavily impacted by big data and analytics. Adapted from McKinsey, as cited in Weber & Zwingmann (2024)](images/figure_1_2.png)

#### Consequences for Businesses

-   Shift from internal efficiency to customer-centricity: Digital tools allow deep customer journey insights.

-   Analytics adoption gap:

    -   Many analytics teams fail to deliver perceived value.

    -   Tools are often “too technical” for average employees.

    -   Lesson from history:

        -   Widespread adoption comes from simplicity (e.g., mouse for computers, touchscreens for phones).

#### The Case for Augmented Analytics

-   Limitations of traditional analytics:

    -   Can’t handle the variety of today’s data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).

    -   Manual tools like Excel or static BI dashboards are insufficient.

-   Augmented analytics goal:

    -   Bring insights to non-data professionals (80% of workforce).

    -   Make analytics intuitive, embedded in workflows, and actionable.

#### Data-Driven Culture

-   Definition: Culture where decisions routinely reference “What does the data say?”

-   Current reality: Most companies lack data literacy—only \~24% of decision-makers feel confident with data.

-   Need: Foster curiosity, analysis, and communication skills alongside technical tools.

#### The People Problem & Limits of Upskilling

-   Aging populations and shrinking workforces mean you can’t simply replace staff.

-   Upskilling is essential but cannot make everyone a “data person.”

    -   Upskilling refers to the process of learning new skills or improving existing ones, typically to keep up with changes in technology, industry practices, or job requirements. It often involves acquiring more advanced, specialized, or updated capabilities that make a person more effective in their current role or prepare them for new opportunities.

        -   For individuals, upskilling helps maintain competitiveness in the job market, adapt to evolving roles, and enhance career growth.

        -   For organizations, upskilling initiatives improve workforce productivity, reduce skill gaps, and strengthen adaptability in fast-changing industries.

-   Suggested Solution: Meet people where they are and give them augmented tools rather than forcing advanced analytics expertise.

#### Transition from Data-Driven to Insight-Driven

-   Data-driven: Focuses on collecting/analyzing data.

-   Insight-driven: Focuses on delivering actionable, user-friendly insights to the majority of employees.

-   Augmented analytics is positioned as the “mouse” of the analytics world—bridging the gap between complexity and usability.

#### Developing Analytical Maturity

#### Overcoming Gulfs and Chasms

![Figure 2-5. Impact and establishment of the four steps of analytical maturity. Reprinted from Weber & Zwingmann (2024)](images/figure_2_5.png)

-   Complexity & Market Establishment:

    -   As organizations progress, complexity increases (vertical axis on top) and market establishment grows (vertical axis on bottom).

    -   Gulfs and a chasm indicate key transition points where many organizations struggle to advance to the next stage.

-   Moving from reactive to fluent requires overcoming organizational, technical, and cultural barriers at these gulfs and chasms, with each stage demanding higher sophistication and broader adoption.

    -   **Gulfs refer to incremental adoption hurdles.**

    -   **Chasms refer to** the big leap from being data-aware to making analytics part of the organizational DNA

## Augmented Analytics

##### Chapter 3 of Weber and Zwingmann discuss why augmented analytics (AA) is critical in today’s fast-changing business environment.

###### Chapter 3 at Weber, W., & Zwingmann, T. (2024). Augmented analytics. O’Reilly Media, Inc. Available at https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/augmented-analytics/9781098151713/

#### Augmented Analytics (AA)

-   Augmented analytics means adding value by providing people with access to technology that gives them the analytical leverage they need to accomplish the business task at hand in a better way.

-   Augmented analytics offers a path to scaling insights across an organization by making them accessible, intuitive, and embedded in decision-making.

-   AA is not just about better tech—it’s about human-centric augmentation that finds the right [“sweet spot” between automation and judgment.]{style="background-color: yellow"}

-   Done right, it becomes integrated, essential, and empowering—helping organizations progress toward Data Fluent maturity.

<!-- -->

-   AA maters because it breaks down the data expert vs. business user divide. Embeds analytics in daily work to make data use habitual and unobtrusive. Uses augmented workflows (analytics inside existing processes) and augmented frames (context-specific, just-in-time insights).

#### Five Key Components Moving from Data Reactive to Data Fluent

1.  People – Human creativity, experience, and judgment remain at the center of analytics. Tools support people, but it’s people who frame questions, interpret results, and make decisions.

2.  Technology – AI, automation, and analytics platforms provide the computational power to process large datasets and enable advanced analytics.

3.  Analytical Leverage – Analytics amplifies human thinking by improving speed, scale, accuracy, and predictive ability—making insights more powerful than intuition alone.

4.  Business Task – Analytics should always be applied to solve real-world, value-driven business problems, not just generate reports for their own sake.

5.  Better Way – The goal is to make decisions that are faster, more reliable, and less biased—leading to better outcomes than gut instinct or outdated methods.

![Figure 3-1. Enablers for each maturity stage. Reprinted from Weber & Zwingmann (2024)](images/figure_3_1.png)

#### Five Traits of Effective AA

-   Insightful – turns data into actionable knowledge.

-   Integrated – embedded into existing workflows and tools.

-   Invisible – works seamlessly in the background.

-   Indispensable – delivers consistent value, becomes essential.

-   Inclusive – usable by all, not just data experts.

![Figure 3-2. Augmented workflow efficiency. Reprinted from Weber & Zwingmann (2024)](images/figure_3_2.png)

#### Types of Bias

-   **Survivorship Bias**

    -   **Definition:** Focusing only on people or things that “survived” a process, ignoring those that did not.

    -   **Example:** Studying successful companies and assuming their strategies guarantee success, without analyzing the failed ones.

-   <span style="background-color: grey">**Confirmation Bias**

    -   **Definition:** Tendency to seek out or favor information that confirms existing beliefs, while ignoring contradictory evidence.

    -   **Example:** Only reading news sources that support your political views.

-   **Sample Bias**

    -   **Definition:** Drawing conclusions from a dataset that is not representative of the entire population.

    -   **Example:** Running a survey only among college students to estimate national voting behavior.</span>

-   **Availability Bias**

    -   **Definition:** Overestimating the importance of information that is easiest to recall, often because it is recent or vivid.

    -   **Example:** Believing plane crashes are common after seeing news coverage of one, despite statistics showing they are rare.

-   **Outlier Bias**

    -   **Definition:** Placing too much emphasis on unusual or extreme cases that may not represent the norm.
    -   **Example:** Using one extraordinary sales month to predict future performance.

![Figure 3-3.Improvability of various types of biases.Reprinted from Weber & Zwingmann (2024)](images/figure_3_3.png)

-   <span style="background-color: grey">**Selection Bias**

    -   **Definition:** Systematic error caused by choosing non-random data that skews results.

    -   **Example:** Studying only patients who complete a treatment program, ignoring those who dropped out.

-   **Cognitive Bias**

    -   **Definition:** A systematic pattern of deviation from rational judgment that affects decisions and thinking.

    -   **Example:** Stereotyping people based on limited personal experiences.</span>

-   **Anchoring Bias**

    -   **Definition:** Relying too heavily on the first piece of information (the “anchor”) when making decisions.

    -   **Example:** Negotiating a salary based primarily on the initial number offered.

-   **Historical Bias**

    -   **Definition:** Bias introduced by data that reflects outdated or inequitable historical conditions.

    -   **Example:** Predictive policing models reinforcing past discriminatory arrest patterns.

#### The Five AI Archetypes

![Figure 3-4.The five AI archetypes. Reprinted from Weber & Zwingmann (2024).](images/figure_3_4.png)

Automation – repeatable, deterministic processes (data prep, reporting, alerts).

AI archetypes –

-   Supervised ML (prediction, classification, anomaly detection, recommendations)

-   Natural Language Processing (NLP) (text analysis, search, summarization, sentiment)

-   Speech (voice-to-text/text-to-voice analytics)

-   Computer vision (document/image analysis)

-   Generative AI (text-to-code, automated reports, conversational queries)

#### Supervised Learning

-   This diagram shows the iterative process of building and maintaining a supervised machine learning model:

    -   Collect Data – Gather relevant, high-quality datasets containing both features (inputs) and labels (outputs).

    -   Define Features and Labels – Identify which variables will be used as predictors (features) and what will be predicted (label).

    -   Train/Test Split – Divide the data into training and testing sets to evaluate performance fairly.

    -   Find Best Model – Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to determine the most effective model.

    -   Evaluate – Measure the model’s accuracy, precision, recall, or other metrics on the test set.

    -   Deploy – Integrate the model into a real-world application or workflow.

    -   Monitor – Continuously check performance, retrain when data drifts, and ensure predictions remain accurate over time.

-   This loop emphasizes continuous improvement — after monitoring, you may need to return to earlier steps to refine the model as new data arrives or conditions change.
