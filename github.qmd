-   This module introduces Git and GitHub as foundational tools for version control, collaboration, and deployment in analytics and programming projects. Git is a decentralized version control system that tracks file changes and manages project history locally, while GitHub is a cloud-based platform built on Git for sharing, collaborating, and managing repositories. Together, they allow multiple contributors to work efficiently through commits, branches, merges, and pull requests. GitLab offers similar features but can be self-hosted for greater organizational control.

-   Students learn to set up Git and GitHub, configure user credentials, and perform essential commands (git init, git add, git commit, git push, etc.) using VS Code or GitHub Desktop. They also explore GitHub CoPilot, an AI-assisted coding tool that autocompletes and suggests code within VS Code.

-   The section covers best practices such as writing clear commit messages, pulling often to stay updated, using .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files, and maintaining a stable main branch. It also outlines common troubleshooting tips for merge conflicts, authentication issues, and accidental commits.

-   Finally, the module introduces Render.com, a platform that connects directly to GitHub for seamless web app deployment. Students link their GitHub repositories to Render to host and automatically update their Dash or analytics applications, gaining hands-on experience with real-world deployment workflows.

##### Understanding the prompting paradigm equips you to guide AI models effectively—skills that can be enhanced and shared by leveraging platforms like GitHub to collaborate on prompt libraries, examples, and AI-powered projects.

#### Purpose of Git

-   Git is a decentralized version control system for tracking file changes, especially in software projects with many small text files. It records who made changes and when, supports collaboration, and keeps all past versions and branches.

-   Works best with text files; less effective for binary files like Word docs, audio/video, or VM images. git Command

    -   The primary way to control Git via the terminal/PowerShell.

    -   Tasks: download projects, commit changes, switch branches, undo edits, etc.

        -   “Git” (capitalized) = the system/concepts;

        -   git (lowercase) = the command.

-   IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio) and editors (e.g., VS Code) offer built-in Git tools; web platforms like GitHub/GitLab add extra features (issue tracking, automated tests).

#### Git vs GitHub vs GitLab

-   Git: Works without central servers.

-   GitHub: Most popular host; acquired by Microsoft in 2018; free for public and most private projects.

    -   A cloud-based platform for hosting and collaborating on code projects

    -   Built on Git (a distributed version control system)

    -   Supports version tracking, collaboration, and project management

        -   Enables teamwork on coding projects

        -   Provides a historical record of changes

        -   Integrates with many tools

-   GitLab: Similar features; open-source, can be self-hosted—good for organizations that want control.

#### Setting Up GitHub

![](images/setup.png)

-   Create an account at github.com

-   Install Git (if using locally): <https://gitforwindows.org/>

-   Configure Git

    -   bash

    -   git config --global user.name "Your Name" git config --global user.email "you\@example.com"

-   Can install GitHub Desktop (optional) for a GUI

-   Use VS Code as Editor

#### CoPilot Autofill

![](images/copilot.png)

-   To change the setting that makes Copilot ghost text appear as you type.

    -   Go to VS Code Settings

    -   Search for Copilot: Inline Suggest.

    -   Ensure that "Editor › Inline Suggest: Enabled" is checked.

#### Key Git Concepts

-   Repository (Repo) – where your project’s code and history live

-   Commit – a saved snapshot of your code

-   Branch – an independent line of development

-   Merge – bringing changes from one branch into another

-   Pull Request (PR) – proposing changes for review

-   Clone – downloading a copy of the repo to your local machine

-   Push – sending your local changes to GitHub

#### Creating Your First Repository

-   Go to GitHub → Click New Repository

-   Name your repo and choose:

    -   Public or Private

    -   Don’t add a README (We are going to push from VS Code, so it is better if the Repo is Blank)

-   Local option: create folder → git init → link to GitHub repo

-   Initial commit example within VS Code:

    -   git init

    -   git add .

    -   git commit -m "Initial commit“

    -   git branch –M main

    -   git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

    -   git push -u origin main

-   Also, notice the source control button on the left of VS Code that has changes to commit.

#### Best Practices

-   Write clear commit messages (“Fix login bug” \> “stuff”)

-   Pull often to stay updated:

    -   bash

    -   git pull origin main

-   Use .gitignore to avoid uploading sensitive or unnecessary files

-   Keep main branch stable

-   Use Issues and Project Boards for task tracking

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

-   Merge conflicts – when two people change the same code section

-   Authentication errors – fix with SSH keys or GitHub token

-   Forgetting to pull – always update before pushing

-   Accidental commits – use git reset or revert commits

#### Render.com

![](images/render.com.png)

-   Easy Git-based Deployment – Connect GitHub or GitLab for automatic builds and updates.

-   Full-Stack Hosting – Run web apps, APIs, static sites, and background jobs on one platform.
