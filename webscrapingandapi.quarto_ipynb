        "-   This section teaches how to acquire web data two ways—by parsing human-oriented HTML (web scraping) and by calling machine-friendly endpoints (APIs)—and shows when to use each. You’ll practice inspecting sites, locating target elements, and extracting fields with requests, Beautiful Soup, and pandas, then contrast that with structured API calls that return predictable JSON (e.g., Open-Meteo). Worked examples cover end-to-end flows (URL anatomy → request → parse/clean → tabulate), common failure points (fragile page structure, missing fields), and hardening tips (headers, error handling). The section closes with an ethics lens—copyright, terms of service, and responsible use—so students can ship useful pipelines that are both technically sound and compliant.\n",

        "#### An Alternative to Web Scraping: APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Some website providers offer application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow you to access their data in a predefined manner. With APIs, you can avoid parsing HTML. Instead, you can access the data directly using formats like JSON and XML.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   API stands for **application programming interface**. In essence, an API acts as a communication layer, or interface, that allows different systems to talk to each other without having to understand exactly what the others do.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Key Advantages of Using APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Structured data – clean JSON or XML format\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Consistent schema – predictable, labeled fields\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Defined access – clear endpoints, parameters, and usage limits\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Easy access – read-only data often requires no authentication\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Best practice – include a descriptive User-Agent in requests\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Requests for Information or Data\n",
        "\n",
        "-   No matter the type, all APIs function mostly the same way. You usually make a request for information or data, and the API returns a response with what you requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   For example, every time you open Twitter or scroll down your Instagram feed, you’re basically making a request to the API behind that app and getting a response in return. This is also known as calling an API.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   When working with APIs in Python, the go-to library is requests. It provides the core functionality needed to interact with most public APIs, covering nearly all common use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Working with APIs in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Python offers versatile tools for working with a wide range of APIs, from web-based services to local system interfaces. Libraries like requests make it straightforward to send and receive data, while specialized packages exist for specific API formats and protocols.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   APIs can follow various architectural styles and formats—such as REST, GraphQL, SOAP, or gRPC—each with its own conventions and strengths. REST remains common for many public services, but others may be better suited for structured queries, high performance, or legacy system integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Access to many APIs requires authentication, which can range from simple API keys to more advanced methods like OAuth or token-based systems. Python supports these through built-in libraries and third-party tools, making it easier to securely interact with protected resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Some APIs require you to obtain an API key by registering for an account with the API provider and generating the key through their developer portal or dashboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Private and Public APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Public APIs = instant start, but limited data.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Private APIs = more powerful, but require sign-up and careful key storage. ![](images/private_and_public.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### API Keys\n",
        "\n",
        "-   An API key is a unique code (usually a long string of letters and numbers) that identifies you to an API.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Controls access, tracks usage, and prevents abuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Think of an API key as a library card for borrowing data — it tells the data provider who you are and how much you can “check out.”\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Example: \"API_KEY\" = \"a8b3c9d1e5f7g2h4i6j8...“\n",
        "\n",
        "-   To get an API key for most private APIs, you’ll first need to create a free account with the data provider. Once logged in, look for a section labeled “API,” “Developers,” or “Account Settings.”\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Most sites have a button or link to “Generate API Key” or “Create Access Token.”\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Clicking this will produce a unique, long string of letters and numbers — your personal API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Copy it and store it somewhere safe (such as a .env file) so it’s not shared publicly.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   This key identifies you every time your code makes a request, allowing the provider to track usage, enforce request limits, and prevent abuse. If your key is lost or accidentally exposed (e.g., uploaded to a public GitHub repo), you should immediately delete or regenerate it through the provider’s website.\n",
